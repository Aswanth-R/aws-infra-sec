# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances AWS Sentinel with additional comprehensive security checks across multiple AWS services. The goal is to expand the current 4 security checks to a more robust set of 15+ security validations covering CloudTrail, RDS, Lambda, VPC, Route53, and other critical AWS services. This will provide users with a more complete security posture assessment of their AWS environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to check CloudTrail logging configuration, so that I can ensure audit trails are properly configured for compliance and security monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning CloudTrail THEN the system SHALL identify trails that are not logging
2. WHEN scanning CloudTrail THEN the system SHALL identify trails without log file validation enabled
3. WHEN scanning CloudTrail THEN the system SHALL identify trails not logging management events
4. IF a trail is found with security issues THEN the system SHALL report it as HIGH severity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to check RDS security configurations, so that I can identify database instances with security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning RDS instances THEN the system SHALL identify databases that are publicly accessible
2. WHEN scanning RDS instances THEN the system SHALL identify databases without encryption at rest
3. WHEN scanning RDS instances THEN the system SHALL identify databases without backup retention configured
4. WHEN scanning RDS snapshots THEN the system SHALL identify public snapshots
5. IF an RDS instance has public access THEN the system SHALL report it as HIGH severity
6. IF an RDS instance lacks encryption THEN the system SHALL report it as MEDIUM severity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cloud architect, I want to check Lambda function security settings, so that I can ensure serverless functions follow security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL identify functions with overly permissive execution roles
2. WHEN scanning Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL identify functions without environment variable encryption
3. WHEN scanning Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL identify functions in public subnets
4. WHEN scanning Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL identify functions with outdated runtime versions
5. IF a Lambda function has excessive permissions THEN the system SHALL report it as HIGH severity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a network security specialist, I want to check VPC and network security configurations, so that I can identify network-level security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning VPCs THEN the system SHALL identify VPCs without flow logs enabled
2. WHEN scanning NACLs THEN the system SHALL identify overly permissive network ACL rules
3. WHEN scanning route tables THEN the system SHALL identify routes with overly broad CIDR blocks
4. WHEN scanning VPC endpoints THEN the system SHALL identify endpoints without policy restrictions
5. IF network configurations allow unrestricted access THEN the system SHALL report it as HIGH severity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to check additional EC2 and EBS security configurations, so that I can identify compute-related security gaps beyond the current checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning EC2 instances THEN the system SHALL identify instances without detailed monitoring
2. WHEN scanning EC2 instances THEN the system SHALL identify instances with default security groups
3. WHEN scanning EBS snapshots THEN the system SHALL identify public snapshots
4. WHEN scanning AMIs THEN the system SHALL identify public AMIs owned by the account
5. IF compute resources have public exposure THEN the system SHALL report it as HIGH severity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want to check Route53 DNS security configurations, so that I can identify DNS-related security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning Route53 hosted zones THEN the system SHALL identify zones without query logging
2. WHEN scanning Route53 records THEN the system SHALL identify wildcard records that may be overly permissive
3. WHEN scanning Route53 health checks THEN the system SHALL identify health checks without SNS notifications
4. IF DNS configurations pose security risks THEN the system SHALL report them with appropriate severity

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to check additional IAM security configurations, so that I can ensure comprehensive identity and access management security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning IAM policies THEN the system SHALL identify policies with wildcard permissions
2. WHEN scanning IAM roles THEN the system SHALL identify roles with overly broad trust relationships
3. WHEN scanning IAM users THEN the system SHALL identify users with programmatic access but no recent activity
4. WHEN scanning IAM access keys THEN the system SHALL identify old or unused access keys
5. WHEN scanning IAM password policy THEN the system SHALL identify weak password requirements
6. IF IAM configurations allow excessive access THEN the system SHALL report them as HIGH severity

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the enhanced security checks to integrate seamlessly with the existing CLI interface, so that I can use familiar commands and output formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running security scans THEN the system SHALL support all existing output formats (table, JSON, CSV)
2. WHEN specifying checks THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by new service categories (cloudtrail, rds, lambda, vpc, route53)
3. WHEN running scans THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing check names
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL use consistent severity levels and formatting
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle AWS API errors gracefully for new services

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new security checks to follow the same architectural patterns as existing checks, so that the codebase remains maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new checks THEN the system SHALL follow the same function signature patterns as existing checks
2. WHEN adding new functionality THEN the system SHALL maintain separation between core logic and CLI interface
3. WHEN creating new checks THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive error handling
4. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL ensure all new functions are unit testable with moto mocking
5. WHEN extending the CLI THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing command structure and help documentation
